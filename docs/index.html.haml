  Debezium is a set of distributed services to capture changes in your databases so that your applications can see those changes and respond to them.
  Debezium records all row-level changes within each database table in a
  %i
    change event stream
  \, and applications simply read these streams to see the change events in the same order in which they occurred.

  Use the links at the left to find the documentation for Debezium, including the various Debezium connectors.
  If you're trying to get your head around what Debezium is or how it works, we recommend starting with our
