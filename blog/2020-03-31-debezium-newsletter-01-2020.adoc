== To to upgrade

Debezium version https://debezium.io/blog/2020/03/24/debezium-1-1-0-final-released/[1.1.0.Final] was released last week.
If you are using an older version, we urge you to check out the latest major release.
For details on the bug fixes, enhancements, and improvements that spanned 5 releases, check out the https://debezium.io/releases/1.1/release-notes/[release-notes].

The Debezium team has also begun active development on the next major version, 1.2.
The major focus in 1.2 is implementing a standalone container to run Debezium without Apache Kafka and Connect, enabling users to send change events to Kinesis and other platforms more easily.

Keep an eye on our https://debezium.io/releases/[releases page] to get a jump start on what bug fixes, enhancements, and changes will be coming in 1.2 as they become available.
