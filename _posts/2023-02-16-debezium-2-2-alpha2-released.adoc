Today, I am pleased to announce the second alpha release the 2.2 release stream, Debezium *2.2.0.Alpha2*.
This release includes a plethora of bug fixes, improvements, breaking changes, and a number of new features including, but not limited to, a new `ExtractRecordChanges` single message transformation, a Reactive-based implementation of the Debezium Outbox extension for Quarkus, a Debezium Storage module for Apache RocketMQ, and much more.
Let's take moment and dive into these new features, improvements, and breaking changes.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Breaking Changes

We typically try to avoid any breaking changes  even during minor releases such as this; however, sometimes breaking changes are inevitable given the circumstances.
Debezium 2.2.0.Alpha2 includes three breaking changes:

* xref:#topic-schema-naming-changes[Topic and schema naming changes]
* xref:#source-info-block-changes-oracle[Source info block changed for Oracle connector]
* xref:#debezium-server-moved-to-new-repository[Debezium Server source code in new repository]

[id="topic-schema-naming-changes"]
=== Topic / Schema naming changes

Debezium previously sanitized topic and schema names by using an underscore (`_`) to replace non-ASCII characters that would lead to unsupported topic or schema names when using schema registries.
However, if this non-ASCII character was the only difference between two similar topics or schema names that otherwise only varied by case, this would lead to other problems.

In order to address this in the most compatible way, Debezium now uses a strategy-based approach to map characters uniquely.
As a side effect of this change, the `sanitize.field.names` configuration property has been retired and replaced by this new strategy-based approach.

Each connector supports two configuration properties to control this behavior:

`schema.name.adjustment.mode`:: Specifies how schema names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter.
`field.name.adjustment.mode`:: Specifies how field names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter.

These two connector configuration properties support three modes:

`none`::
  No adjustment is made to the schema or field names, passed as-is.
`avro`::
  Replaces characters that cannot be used in Avro with an underscore (`_`).
`avro_unicode`::
  Replaces underscores (`_`) and characters that cannot be used in Avro with unicode-based characters.

This now allows you to pick the most appropriate strategy based on your table or collection naming convention.

[id="source-info-block-changes-oracle"]
=== Source info block changes with Oracle connector

All Debezium change events related to inserts, updates, and deletes contain a `source` info block in the event's payload.
For the Oracle connector, this block contains a special field called `ssn` that represents the SQL sequence number for this change.

It has been identified that there were corner cases where the value sourced from the database for this field could exceed the maximum value of `2,147,483,647`, or the maximum value of an `INT32` data type.
To fix this corner case, we've changed the data type from `INT32` to `INT64`, which allows up to a maximum value of  `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`.

This change should be entirely non-invasive, but we wanted to bring attention to this should you have pipelines that could be storing this value in a sink system or if you are using a schema registry.

[id="debezium-server-moved-to-new-repository"]
=== Debezium Server moved to new repository

Debezium Server is a standalone Quarkus-based runtime for Debezium source connectors enabling the integration with various platforms like EventHubs, PubSub, Pulsar, Redis, and Kafka, to name a few.
With this release, we have moved the code related to Debezium Server to its own https://www.github.com/debezium/debezium-server[GitHub repository].

This change was required in order to support building Debezium Server to include connectors that are not part of the main Debezium repository, connectors such as Db2, Google Spanner, Cassandra 4, and Vitess.
Therefore, this means that starting with this release, Debezium Server now ships with all connectors (excluding Cassandra 3) by default.

[NOTE]
====
Cassandra 3 is excluded due to some technical limitations with class loading that creates conflicts with Cassandra 4.
We are aware of this and plan to deliver a solution to include Cassandra 3 in the future.
====

== New ExtractChangedRecordState SMT

We have heard from the community on several occasions that it would great to have an out-of-the-box way to determine what values have changed in a Debezium change event.
The new single message transform (SMT) `ExtractChangedRecordState` aims to deliver on this request by adding metadata to the event identifying which fields changed or were unchanged.

In order to get started with this new transformation, configure it as part of your connector configuration:

[source,properties]
----
transforms=changes
transforms.changes.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractChangedRecordState
transforms.changes.header.changed=ChangedFields
transforms.changes.header.unchanged=UnchangedFields
----

This transformation can be configured to disclose either what fields changed by setting `header.changed`, what fields are unchanged by setting `header.unchanged`, or both by setting both properties as shown above.
The transformation will add a new header with the specified name and it's value will include a collection of field names based on whether you've configured changes, non-changes, or both.

== Drop fields using ExtractNewRecordState SMT

The `ExtractNewRecordState` single message transformation is extremely useful in situations where you need to consume the Debezium change event in a _flattened_ format.
This SMT has been changed in this release to add the ability to drop fields from the payload and the message key of the event.

This new feature introduces three new configuration properties for the transformation:

`drop.fields.header.name`::
  The Kafka message header name to use for listing field names in the source message that are to be dropped.
`drop.fields.from.key`::
  Specifies whether to remove fields also from the key, defaults to `false`.
`drop.fields.keep.schema.compatible`::
  Specifies whether to remove fields that are only optional, defaults to `true`.

[NOTE]
====
When using Avro, schema compatibility is extremely important.
This is why we opted to enforce schema compatibility by default.
If a field is configured to be dropped but it is non-optional, the field will not be removed from the key nor the payload unless schema compatibility is disabled.
====

These new configuration options allow for some exciting ways to manipulate change events.
For example, to emit events with only changed fields, pairing the `ExtractNewRecordState` with the new `ExtractChangedRecordState` transformation makes this extremely simple and straightforward.
An example configuration to only emit changed columns would look like the following:

[source,properties]
----
transforms=changes,extract
transforms.changes.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractChangedRecordState
transforms.changes.header.unchanged=UnchangedFields
transforms.extract.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
transforms.extract.drop.fields.header.name=UnchangedFields
----

The above configuration will explicitly not include unchanged fields from the event's payload value.
If a field in the key did not change, it will be unaffected because `drop.fields.from.key` was left as its default of `false`.
And finally, if a field in the event's payload is to be dropped because it did not change, but it's not optional, it will continue to be included in the transformation's output event to comply with schema compatibility.

== Reactive Debezium Outbox Quarkus Extension

The https://debezium.io/blog/2019/02/19/reliable-microservices-data-exchange-with-the-outbox-pattern/[outbox pattern] is an approach that many microservices leverage to share data across microservice boundaries.
We introduced the Debezium Outbox Quarkus Extension in Debezium 1.1 back in early 2020, and it has allowed Quarkus users to leverage the outbox pattern with ease using Debezium.

Thanks to https://github.com/ingmarfjolla[Ingmar Fjolla], Debezium 2.2.0.Alpha2 includes a new reactive-based implementation of the Debezium Outbox Quarkus Extension.
This new implementation is based on Vert.x and Hibernate Reactive, providing a fully asynchronous solution to the outbox pattern using Debezium.

This new extension will be included in the Quarkus Platform releases latter this quarter or early Q2, however, if you want to get started with it today, you can easily drop it directly into your project's configuration using the following coordinates:

.Maven coordinates
[source,xml]

</dependency>

== New Rocket MQ Schema History Storage

Debezium's new storage API has been a huge success over this past year.
We initially started with our original file and Kafka based implementations for offset and schema history storage, but that has since grown to support storing schema history on other platforms such as Amazon S3 and Redis.

This release continues to expand on this by adding a new schema history storage implementation for Rocket MQ.
In order to get started with storing your schema history into Rocket MQ, the `debezium-storage-rocketmq` dependency must first be on the classpath and accessible by the connector runtime.

Once the dependency exists, the only remaining step will be configuring the schema history connector configuration.
The following example shows basic usage of the Rocket MQ schema history:

[source,properties]
----
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.topic=schema-history
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.name.srv.addr=172.17.15.2
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.acl.enabled=true
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.access.key=<rocketmq-access-key>
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.secret.key=<rocketmq-secret-key>
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.recovery.attempts=5
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.recovery.poll.interval.ms=1000
schema.history.internal.rocketmq.store.record.timeout.ms=2000
----

`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.topic`::
  Specifies the topic name where the schema history will be stored.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.name.srv.addr`::
  Specifies the service discovery service nameserver for Rocket MQ.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.acl.enabled`::
  Specifies whether access control lists (ACLs) are enabled, defaults to `false`.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.access.key`::
  Specifies the Rocket MQ access key, required only if ACLs are enabled.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.secret.key`::
  Specifies the Rocket MQ secret key, required only if ACLs are enabled.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.recovery.attempts`::
  Specifies the number of sequential attempts that no data is returned before recovery completes.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.recovery.poll.interval.ms`::
  Specifies the number of milliseconds for each poll attempt to recover the history.
`schema.history.internal.rocketmq.store.record.timeout.ms`::
  Specifies the number of milliseconds for a write to Rocket MQ to complete before timing out.

== What's Next?

We're still very early in the development cycle of Debezium 2.2 and many other features are still in development, including:

* Configurable signal channels, enabling users to send signals not only from a database table or a Kafka topic, but also from other means such as an HTTP endpoint, the file system, etc.
* The Debezium JDBC sink connector that supports native Debezium change events out-of-the-box, without requiring the use of the Event Flattening transformation.
* And a plethora of Debezium UI enhancements

We are about middle way through the quarter and Debezium 2.2 will begin to enter beta phase very soon.
We would love to hear your feedback or suggestions regarding the roadmap, changes in this release, those that are outstanding, or anything we haven't mentioned.
