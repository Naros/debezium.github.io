It is my pleasure to announce the next Debezium 2.3 release, *2.3.0.CR1*!

The main focus of this release is to stabilize the Debezium 2.3 release in preparation for a final release in the coming weeks,
which typically means we're focusing on bugfixes; however,
this release includes two new features.
Lets take a moment and dive into these new features and any bug fixes that are noteworthy!

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Breaking Changes

This release includes no breaking changes, so upgrading from Debezium 2.3.0.Beta1 to 2.3.0.CR1 should be a simple drop-in replacement.

If you are upgrading from a prior version, please review the https://debezium.io/releases/2.3/release-notes[release notes] for any migration steps that may be necessary.

== Debezium Server Kubernetes Operator

This release introduces a _preview_ version of the new Debezium Operator, providing the ability to deploy and manage Debezium Server instances within Kubernetes.
Debezium Server allows you to stream change events from your data sources to a wide variety of messaging infrastructures.
Our goal is to provide a Kafka-less alternative for the Debezium community who wish to utilize Kubernetes for scalability and high availability deployments.

Presently, the documentation is sparse as the operator is in early incubation stages; however, we do intend to improve upon this throughout the remainder of the 2.3 as well into the Debezium 2.4 release cycles.
You can find a https://github.com/debezium/debezium-operator#quickstart-example[deployment example] and basic description of the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-operator#debeziumserverspec-reference[custom resource specification] in the github repository that you can use as a reference for the short-term.

We do not recommend a production deployment of this component at this time; however, we encourage users to provide community feedback.
The feedback will be valuable in evaluating if the component is feature ready or if there are still areas of improvement to meet everyone's needs.

== JMX signals and notifications

Debezium 2.3 previously introduced both a new signal channel and notification feature.
This feature allows external applications to easily integrate with Debezium, sending signals to perform various tasks such as ad-hoc incremental snapshots, and to receive notifications about the progress of such tasks.
This release builds on top of that functionality to allow the ability to send signals and receive notifications via JMX.

=== Sending signals

In this release, the signal channel subsystem has been improved to support sending signals via JMX.
From the `jconsole` window, you can now see there are two new subsections for a connector, a notifications and signal section shown below:

====

The new `signals` section allows you to invoke an operation on the JMX bean in order to transmit a signal to Debezium.
This signal resembles the logical signal table structure where it accepts 3 parameters, a unique identifier, the signal type, and finally the signal payload.
The following illustrates what this looks like from `jconsole`:

=== Receiving notifications

The new `notifications` section allows you to receive and react to notifications captured by the JMX bean from Debezium.
The Debezium JMX bean will buffer all notifications to ensure that no notification is missed.
The following illustrates what this looks like from `jconsole`:

[.imageblock.centered-image]
====

[NOTE]
====
The JMX bean does not automatically clear the notification queue.
In order to avoid memory concerns, be sure to invoke the `reset` method on the notifications bean once you've processed all notifications.
====

We look forward to your feedback on this new way to integrate signals and notifications with Debezium over JMX.
