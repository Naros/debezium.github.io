We are happy to announce the second maintenance release of the Debezium 2.5 release stream, **Debezium 2.5.2.Final**.
This release includes some improvements and numerous bug fixes, so let's dive right in...

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Improvements and changes

=== Scoped Key/Trust - store support with MongoDB

Debezium supports secure connections; however, MongoDB requires that the key/trust -store configurations be supplied as JVM process arguments, which is less than ideal for environments in the cloud.
This feature was first introduced as part of Debezium 2.6, and we've opted to back-port this to Debezium 2.5.
This new change allows per connector scoped key/trust -store configurations as part of the connector configuration (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7379[DBZ-7379]).

The MongoDB connector now includes the following new configuration properties:

`mongodb.ssl.keystore`::
Specifies the path to the SSL keystore file.

`mongodb.ssl.keystore.password`::
Specifies the credentials to open and access the SSL keystore provided by _mongodb.ssl.keystore_.

`mongodb.ssl.keystore.type`::
Specifies the SSL keystore file type, defaults to `PKC512`.

`mongodb.ssl.truststore`::
Specifies the path to the SSL truststore file.

`mongodb.ssl.truststore.password`::
Specifies the credentials to open and access the SSL truststore provided by _mongodb.ssl.truststore_.

`mongodb.ssl.truststore.type`::
Specifies the SSL truststore file type, defaults to `PKC512`.

== Outlook &amp; What's next?

We are just over a month away from the next minor installment, Debezium 2.6.
This next release is packed with tons of new features and changes that we are excited to share. We encourage you to take a moment, grab the pre-releases available https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/nightly/install.html#_installing_a_debezium_connector[here], and share your feedback.

In a few short weeks, the team will begin to shift focus to what lies ahead with Debezium 2.7.
This will be the last minor release of the Debezium 2.x release stream, which will include read-only incremental snapshots for other connectors, a new dedicated MariaDB source connector, and a MongoDB sink connector, just to name a few highlights.
We will also be carrying over any work from 2.6 that we're still working on but didn't make it into that release.

And in closing, the last half of the year will be focusing on Debezium 3, where we'll be moving to Java 17, work on new time-series source connectors, and more.
Please take a moment and review our link:/docs/roadmap[road map].
