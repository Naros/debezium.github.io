# A list of redirects picked up by the RedirectCreator extension
# For each key in this file, a yaml object should be defined that specifies the following key values
#   canonical : true/false specifying whether the redirect should be appended to the canonical site configuration
#   redirect  : the url in which the browser should be redirected to.

# Now that documentation is organized by release series, there were quite a number of old link references
# in blogs, release notes, etc which became invalid.  In order to allow those links to remain valid, we
# opted to have them redirect to the latest stable series in most cases.
#
# In `redirect_creator.rb`, the `parse_target` method allows substitution of specific variables for this
# exact purpose, allowing these links to dynamically shift as release data is changed.  Currently the
# class supports 2 variables:
#
#   ${latest_stable_series} - This is the latest series that has been marked stable.
#   ${latest_series}        - The most recent release series, often times refers to the development series.

# We had several old links for the older tutorials that have also been reorganized by release.
# To maintain those, we've added redirects here as well, but these specifically point to the direct release series.
